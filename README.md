## README

I reckon you should hire me as one of the following:

* Software architect and engineer
* DevOps architect and engineer
* UX and design tester
* Consulting systems engineer
* Technical bid lead

You need more information than that, though. Of course.

To qualify me in or out, you need my [curriculum vitae](CV.md).

If you're involved in the open source community, you'll also need to see 
some of my work. As I wasn't able to open source any of it, I intend to
gratuitously over-engineer my CV in order to give you a taste of what I
could do for you.
