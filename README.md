I reckon you should hire me.

You need more information than that, though.

You need to qualify me in or out based on what I can do and what you need.
For that, you need a list of what I can do. If you're involved in the open
source community, you'd also like to see some of my work. 

I wasn't able to open source any of my work, I'm afraid. So, I'm going to
gratuitously over-engineer my CV in order to give you a taste of what I
could do for you.
